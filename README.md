### Use Cases for AI Agents

The Enhanced Sequential Thinking Server provides powerful tools for AI agents to enhance their reasoning capabilities. Here are some practical use cases:

#### 1. Complex Problem Solving
AI agents can use the server to break down complex problems into manageable thought chains:

```python
# Example: Solving a complex business strategy problem
thought_chain = [
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Analyze current market conditions and identify key trends",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.SYSTEMIC,
        tags=["market_analysis", "trends"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Evaluate potential risks and opportunities in identified trends",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.EVALUATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
        tags=["risk_assessment", "opportunities"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Generate strategic recommendations based on analysis",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.HYPOTHESIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CREATIVE,
        tags=["strategy", "recommendations"]
    )
]
```

#### 2. Research and Analysis
For research tasks, agents can utilize different thinking strategies:

- **Linear Analysis** for step-by-step research:
  ```python
  EnhancedThinkingInput(
      thought="Review existing literature on quantum computing applications",
      thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
      strategy=ThinkingStrategy.LINEAR,
      tags=["research", "literature_review"]
  )
  ```

- **Divergent Thinking** for exploring multiple perspectives:
  ```python
  EnhancedThinkingInput(
      thought="Explore alternative approaches to renewable energy storage",
      thought_type=ThoughtType.QUESTION,
      strategy=ThinkingStrategy.DIVERGENT,
      tags=["innovation", "energy_storage"]
  )
  ```

#### 3. Decision Making
Agents can use the server for structured decision-making processes:

1. **Observation Phase**:
   ```python
   EnhancedThinkingInput(
       thought="Current system performance metrics and user feedback",
       thought_type=ThoughtType.OBSERVATION,
       strategy=ThinkingStrategy.LINEAR,
       tags=["metrics", "feedback"]
   )
   ```

2. **Analysis Phase**:

       thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
       strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
       tags=["impact_analysis", "system_changes"]
   )
   ```

3. **Strategy Adaptation**:
   ```python
   StrategyAdaptationInput(
       current_strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
       effectiveness_score=0.8,
       context="System optimization decision",
       constraints=["time", "resources"]
   )
   ```

#### 4. Creative Problem Solving
For creative tasks, agents can combine different thinking strategies:

```python
# Example: Product innovation process
creative_chain = [
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Identify user pain points in current solutions",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.OBSERVATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.LINEAR,
        tags=["user_research", "pain_points"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Generate innovative solution concepts",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.HYPOTHESIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CREATIVE,

        thought_type=ThoughtType.EVALUATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.STRATEGIC,
        tags=["feasibility", "impact"]
    )
]
```

#### 5. Metacognitive Analysis
Agents can use metacognitive reflection to improve their thinking processes:

```python
# Example: Improving reasoning quality
MetacognitionInput(
    focus_area="Quality of market analysis",
    analysis_depth=3
)
```

#### 6. Quality Assurance
For validation and verification tasks:

```python
# Example: Code review process
qa_chain = [
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Review code for potential security vulnerabilities",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
        tags=["security", "code_review"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(

        thought_type=ThoughtType.EVALUATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.SYSTEMIC,
        tags=["maintainability", "scalability"]
    )
]
```

Each use case demonstrates how AI agents can leverage the server's tools to:
- Structure complex reasoning processes
- Maintain logical consistency
- Adapt thinking strategies based on context
- Track and analyze thought patterns
- Generate well-reasoned conclusions
- Improve decision-making quality

The server's ability to handle different types of thoughts (analysis, hypothesis, evaluation, etc.) and thinking strategies (linear, critical, creative, etc.) makes it particularly valuable for AI agents working on complex, multi-step tasks that require sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

## üîÑ Session Management

The Enhanced Sequential Thinking Server provides robust session management capabilities for handling multiple concurrent thinking processes:

### Session Lifecycle
- **Creation:** Sessions are automatically created when a client connects to the SSE endpoint
- **Identification:** Each session receives a unique UUID (e.g., `e1e8e0732ac84c908deabf136c6a1a69`)
- **Duration:** Sessions persist until explicitly closed or timeout
- **Concurrency:** Multiple sessions can run simultaneously

### Session Operations
```python
# Example: Working with sessions
async with sse_client(url="http://localhost:8000/sse") as (read_stream, write_stream):
    session = ClientSession(read_stream, write_stream)
    await session.initialize()
    
    # Send thoughts within the session
    result = await session.call_tool("enhanced_thinking", {
        "thought": "Analyzing market trends",
        "thought_type": "ANALYSIS",
        "strategy": "SYSTEMIC"
    })
    
    # Export session data
    export_result = await session.call_tool("export_thinking_session", {
        "format_type": "markdown"  # or "json", "summary"
    })
```

### Session Analysis
The server provides tools for analyzing thinking sessions:

```python
# Get session analysis
analysis = await session.call_tool("analyze_thinking_session")

# Get thinking path for a specific thought
path = await session.call_tool("get_thinking_path", {
    "thought_id": "thought_123"
})

# Perform metacognitive reflection
reflection = await session.call_tool("metacognitive_reflection", {
    "focus_area": "Reasoning quality",
    "analysis_depth": 3
})
```

### Session Export Formats
