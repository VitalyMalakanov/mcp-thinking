```bash
MCP_SERVER_PORT=8080 docker-compose up
```

### Language Selection

#### Local Run
To switch to Russian, set the environment variable:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell

python enhanced_sequential_thinking_server.py

# Windows Command Prompt
set LANG=ru
python enhanced_sequential_thinking_server.py

# macOS/Linux
LANG=ru python enhanced_sequential_thinking_server.py
```

#### Docker Run
Add to your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  mcp-server:
    environment:
      - LANG=ru
```

Or set directly when running:
```bash
LANG=ru docker-compose up
```

### Use Cases for AI Agents

The Enhanced Sequential Thinking Server provides powerful tools for AI agents to enhance their reasoning capabilities. Here are some practical use cases:

#### 1. Complex Problem Solving
AI agents can use the server to break down complex problems into manageable thought chains:

```python
# Example: Solving a complex business strategy problem
thought_chain = [
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Analyze current market conditions and identify key trends",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.SYSTEMIC,
        tags=["market_analysis", "trends"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Evaluate potential risks and opportunities in identified trends",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.EVALUATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
        tags=["risk_assessment", "opportunities"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Generate strategic recommendations based on analysis",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.HYPOTHESIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CREATIVE,
        tags=["strategy", "recommendations"]
    )
]
```

#### 2. Research and Analysis
For research tasks, agents can utilize different thinking strategies:

- **Linear Analysis** for step-by-step research:
  ```python
  EnhancedThinkingInput(
      thought="Review existing literature on quantum computing applications",
      thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
      strategy=ThinkingStrategy.LINEAR,
      tags=["research", "literature_review"]
  )
  ```

- **Divergent Thinking** for exploring multiple perspectives:
  ```python
  EnhancedThinkingInput(
      thought="Explore alternative approaches to renewable energy storage",
      thought_type=ThoughtType.QUESTION,
      strategy=ThinkingStrategy.DIVERGENT,
      tags=["innovation", "energy_storage"]
  )
  ```

#### 3. Decision Making
Agents can use the server for structured decision-making processes:

1. **Observation Phase**:
   ```python
   EnhancedThinkingInput(
       thought="Current system performance metrics and user feedback",
       thought_type=ThoughtType.OBSERVATION,
       strategy=ThinkingStrategy.LINEAR,
       tags=["metrics", "feedback"]
   )
   ```

2. **Analysis Phase**:
   ```python
   EnhancedThinkingInput(
       thought="Evaluate impact of potential system changes",
       thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
       strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
       tags=["impact_analysis", "system_changes"]
   )
   ```

3. **Strategy Adaptation**:
   ```python
   StrategyAdaptationInput(
       current_strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
       effectiveness_score=0.8,
       context="System optimization decision",
       constraints=["time", "resources"]
   )
   ```

#### 4. Creative Problem Solving
For creative tasks, agents can combine different thinking strategies:

```python
# Example: Product innovation process
creative_chain = [
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Identify user pain points in current solutions",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.OBSERVATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.LINEAR,
        tags=["user_research", "pain_points"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Generate innovative solution concepts",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.HYPOTHESIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CREATIVE,
        tags=["innovation", "concepts"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Evaluate feasibility and potential impact",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.EVALUATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.STRATEGIC,
        tags=["feasibility", "impact"]
    )
]
```

#### 5. Metacognitive Analysis
Agents can use metacognitive reflection to improve their thinking processes:

```python
# Example: Improving reasoning quality
MetacognitionInput(
    focus_area="Quality of market analysis",
    analysis_depth=3
)
```

#### 6. Quality Assurance
For validation and verification tasks:

```python
# Example: Code review process
qa_chain = [
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Review code for potential security vulnerabilities",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.ANALYSIS,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.CRITICAL,
        tags=["security", "code_review"]
    ),
    EnhancedThinkingInput(
        thought="Evaluate code maintainability and scalability",
        thought_type=ThoughtType.EVALUATION,
        strategy=ThinkingStrategy.SYSTEMIC,
        tags=["maintainability", "scalability"]
    )
]
```

Each use case demonstrates how AI agents can leverage the server's tools to:
- Structure complex reasoning processes
- Maintain logical consistency
- Adapt thinking strategies based on context
- Track and analyze thought patterns
- Generate well-reasoned conclusions
- Improve decision-making quality

The server's ability to handle different types of thoughts (analysis, hypothesis, evaluation, etc.) and thinking strategies (linear, critical, creative, etc.) makes it particularly valuable for AI agents working on complex, multi-step tasks that require sophisticated reasoning capabilities.
